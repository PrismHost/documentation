## Dedicated Servers

### What's the difference between a VPS & Dedicated Server?

Yes, we use a modified instance of TenantOS to allow you to manage everything about your server from installing operating systems to ipmi/kvm access.

Yes, any Windows server option above 2019 is available. Alternatively, you can install your own OS through impi/kvm.
