6. Once you've chosen the plan you want to upgrade/downgrade to, you'll be taken to the checkout page. Please note, refunds will not occur for downgrades. Upgrade price is calculated from a credit of the unused portion of the current plan and billing of the new plan for the same period.
7. Once you've placed the order, your service will be upgraded/downgraded as soon as the payment is verified. If you are currently using more resources then what your plan allows, you will be required to upgrade before your service will become available.
