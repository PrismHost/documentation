import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Requirements

To proceed, you'll need:

- A **VPS or Dedicated Server** with a running **FiveM/RedM server** using txAdmin. If you don't have one, [here's a guide on how to set it up](/vps-guides/setup-fivem-redm-server)
- A **Cloudflare account** with an active domain. If you don't have one, you can [Create a Cloudflare Account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)

## Step 1: Setup Your Domain on Cloudflare

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Add Your Domain to Cloudflare  
        Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and add your domain if it isnâ€™t already there.

        > DNS settings should point to your VPS or dedicated server.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Navigate to Tunnels  
        Go to:
        **Account Home** > **Zero Trust** > **Networks** > **Tunnels**

        > If this is your first time using Zero Trust, you'll be prompted to initialize it. Choose a name for your organization (it can be anything), and select the **Free plan** if prompted for payment.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure and Download the Cloudflare Tunnel

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Create a New Tunnel  
        Click **Add a Tunnel**  
        - Select **cloudflared**
        - Name the tunnel something relevant like `txadmin`
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Install cloudflared  
        Download and install `cloudflared` for your respective operating system directly from:

        - [Cloudflare Tunnel Windows Installer](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe)
        - or [Other Releases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/#latest-release)

        Extract it to a convenient location such as `C:\cloudflared`.
    </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Run the Cloudflare Tunnel

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Open Command Prompt  
        Open Command Prompt and change to the directory where `cloudflared.exe` is located:
        ```bash
        cd C:\cloudflared
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Run the Tunnel Command  
        In the Cloudflare dashboard, a command will be provided after creating the tunnel (e.g. `cloudflared tunnel run txadmin`).  
        Copy and run that command in your terminal to start the tunnel.
    </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Route the Tunnel to txAdmin

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Route the Tunnel to txAdmin
        #### Create a Public URL for txAdmin  
        Back in the Cloudflare dashboard, add a **Public Hostname** for your tunnel.

        - **Subdomain**: Use something memorable like `txadmin`  
        - **Domain**: Select your Cloudflare-managed domain  
        - **Service Type**: `HTTP`  
        - **URL**: `http://localhost:40120` *(or the custom txAdmin port if you've changed it)*

        This will route traffic from `txadmin.yourdomain.com` directly and securely to your txAdmin panel.
    </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Final Notes

- Ensure your txAdmin port is **open on your firewall** and **accessible on the server**. [View Port Forwarding Guide](/vps-guides/open-ports)

- To keep the tunnel running continuously, consider installing `cloudflared` as a service using:
    ```bash
    cloudflared service install
    ```

- Your txAdmin panel is now securely available at txadmin.yourdomain.com with no need to expose raw IPs or ports publicly.
