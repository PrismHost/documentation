## Installing MariaDB (MySQL) on Windows

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Download MariaDB 
        Go to the official download site:  
        [https://mariadb.org/download](https://mariadb.org/download)

        Select the appropriate version for Windows and download the installer.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Launch the MariaDB Installer  
        After downloading, open the installer and follow the prompts.

        - Accept the license agreement
        - Choose the components you wish to install (default is recommended)

        **Optional but Recommended:**  
        When prompted, set a **root password** that you will remember. This password will be used to access and manage your database.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Choose a Tool to Manage Your Databases  
        You will need a graphical interface to manage your databases easily. Here are two recommended options:

        - **HeidiSQL**: Included with MariaDB during installation, no separate download required
        - **DBeaver**: Available at [https://dbeaver.io](https://dbeaver.io)

        If you installed HeidiSQL with MariaDB, you can launch it directly from your Start Menu.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Connecting to your database (Optional)
        Launch either HeidiSQL or DBeaver and create a new connection.

        **Connection Details:**
        - Host: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
        - Username: `root`
        - Port: `3306`
        - Password: The one you set during installation (leave blank if you did not set one)

        Once these details are filled in, connect to the server.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Create a Database (Optional)
        Once connected to the server:

        - Click to create a new database
        - Name the database something relevant to your project (e.g. `fivem_data`, `gamepanel`, etc.)
        - Leave default settings unless you have specific needs
        - Save and refresh to confirm it has been created
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Done
        Your MariaDB server is now installed and ready to use. You can begin importing tables, connecting scripts, or integrating it with your project.

        > If you are setting this up for a FiveM/RedM server, you'd enter the connection details from [step 4](#connecting-to-your-database-optional) into the txAdmin deployer.
    </Step>
</Steps>
