## Folder Setup

Let's start by preparing your folder structure.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Create Your Server Folder  
        On your Desktop (or any location you prefer), create the following structure:

        <Files>
            <Folder name="Desktop" defaultOpen>
                <Folder name="FiveM Server" defaultOpen>
                    <Folder name="Artifacts" defaultOpen>
                    </Folder>
                </Folder>
            </Folder>
        </Files>

        This will help keep your server files organized and easy to manage.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Downloading the Server Artifacts

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Get the Latest Artifacts  
        Download the latest server artifacts from the official source:   [runtime.fivem.net](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)

        > Alternatively, we recommend you use [artifacts.jgscripts.com](https://artifacts.jgscripts.com) for a better source with validated functional artifacts.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Extract to the Artifacts Folder  
        Extract the downloaded ZIP file to the `Artifacts/` folder you created earlier.

        > You may need a utility like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), WinRAR or [NanaZip](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8g7tscl18r?hl=en-US&gl=US) (Recommended) to extract the artifacts.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting txAdmin

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Launch fxserver.exe  
        Inside your `Artifacts/` folder, **run `FXServer.exe`**.

        > If you get a prompt asking for permission, click "Yes"/"Allow"/"Accept"/"Run Anyway". 
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Connect Your CFX Account  
        A browser window should open asking you to **connect your CFX.re account**.

        > If the window doesn't open automatically, check the server console for a PIN code and visit:  
        [http://localhost:40120](http://localhost:40120)  
        Enter the PIN to link your account manually.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Server Setup via txAdmin

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Choose Your Deployment Type  
        After linking your account, txAdmin will ask what kind of server you want to set up.  
        Choose from:
        - Base Template
        - **QBox** (Recommended over QBCore)
        - QBCore (Not recommended, use QBox instead)
        - ESX
        - RedM
        - And others

        > QBox is a modern, performance-oriented alternative to QBCore. You can read more [here](https://qbox.re)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Server Data Location  
        You can choose a custom location for server data if you'd like, but leaving it as the default is completely fine.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Review & Confirm  
        On the "Review Recipe" page, double-check your configuration and click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Enter Your License Key  
        You'll be prompted to enter a **server license key**. If you don't have one, you need to create one on the [CFX Portal](https://portal.cfx.re) by clicking on "Servers" then "Generate Key" after logging in.

        > You may also be asked to configure a database before continuing.  
        [Here's a guide on how you can](vps-guides/setup-mariadb-windows), if you haven't already.

## You're Done!

Your FiveM or RedM server is now ready to go!

To connect to it:
- Use **Direct Connect** in your FiveM/RedM client with the server IP by pressing `F8` and typing `connect 123.456.78.90` (but with your VPS IP address).
- Or search for your server in the server browser via the name you chose during setup (Not the name you chose for the license key).

## Troubleshooting Connection

> If you're having trouble connecting to your server: Make sure port **30120** (or whatever port specified in the server.cfg file) is open in your Windows Firewall with both the TCP & UDP protocol. [Here's a guide on how to open ports in the Windows/Linux Firewall](/vps-guides/open-ports)

> Additionally, if you want txAdmin accessible externally, you can open port **40120** with the TCP protocol, and access it via your VPS IP:40120 (ie, 123.456.78.90:40120). If you do this, we recommend you tunnel it via cloudflare - here's a [guide on how to do that](/vps-guides/cloudflare-tunnel-txadmin)
