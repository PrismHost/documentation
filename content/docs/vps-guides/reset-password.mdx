    <Step>
        #### Open the Options Menu  
        In the top menu, click on **Options**.
    </Step>

        #### Scroll Down to "Root/Administrator Password"

## Option 2: Change Password Inside the VPS

If you already have access to your VPS, you can change the password directly from within the operating system.

---

### Windows

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Connect to Your VPS  
        Use **Remote Desktop Connection** to log in with your current Administrator credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Open the User Management Interface  
        Press `Win + R`, type `control userpasswords2`, and press Enter.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Change the Password  
        - Select the `Administrator` user  
        - Click **Reset Password**  
        - Enter your new password and confirm

        Alternatively, you can use Command Prompt (as Administrator):
        ```powershell
        net user Administrator NewSecurePassword123
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Linux

<Steps>
    <Step>
    #### Connect to your VPS via SSH  
    Use a terminal or SSH client like PuTTY:
    ```bash
    ssh root@your.vps.ip
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    #### Change the Root Password  
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    passwd
    ```
    Enter the new password twice when prompted.

    > Additionally, if you want to change another users password, just run this command as that user - or, as root, run `passwd user` to change it for another user.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Done  
        The password will be updated immediately.
    </Step>
</Steps>
