## Steps

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Log in to the management panel  
        Use the login link provided in your email and sign in with your credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Select and Manage Your server  
        On the panel, locate your server and click the **Manage** button next to it.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Begin OS Installation  
        Click on the "Reinstallation" tab and select the operating system and the version you wish to install. You'll then need to scroll down and fill in the following details

        Details:

        - SSH Key (Optional):
            An SSH key is a more secure way to connect to your dedicated server, usually we recommend setting this up.
        - Hostname (Optional):
            The server's hostname, this is usually a domain name that matches the servers IP address. If you are unsure if you need it, you don't and can safely ignore it.
        - Root Password:
            The password to the `root` account.

        > **WARNING**: If you are reinstalling the OS, this will **delete all data** on the server. Please be sure you've backed up any necessary and important data beforehand. We are not able to restore your data after a reinstall.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Continue with installation

        Click on "Begin Installation" to begin the install process.

        The installation process usually takes a few minutes, but in some cases it may take up to 60 minutes. You'll see progress indicators and a confirmation once it's complete.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### You're Ready to Connect!  
        Once the OS is installed, your server is ready to connect.
