## Steps

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Check Your Email  
        After purchasing a Dedicated Server, you'll receive an email with your **Dedicated panel login details**. 
        
        This includes:
        - Panel URL  
        - Username (usually your email)  
        - Password
        
        > If you haven't purchased one, you can [check out our servers here](https://prism-host.com/dedicated)!

        > **Note**: We **highly** recommend you reset this password for security. [Here's a guide](/dedicated-server-guides/reset-password) on how you can reset it
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Log in to the panel  
        Visit the link provided in your email and enter your credentials to access your dedicated server dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Select and Manage Your Server  
        On the panel dashboard, you'll see a list of your active servers.  
        Click **Manage** next to the server you want to work with.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Install Your Operating System  
        Once on the server management page, you can install your preferred OS using the built-in installer. If you chose one doing checkout, you can skip this step.

    </Step>

        Once your OS is installed and ready, you can connect to your server:

        - **Windows VPS** - Connect using Remote Desktop Connection  
        - **Linux VPS** - Connect using SSH via Windows Terminal
