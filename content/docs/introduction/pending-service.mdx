If you've recently purchased a service and the order status is stuck on "Pending", there may have been an issue with the automatic provisioner used to deploy your service as soon as the payment is confirmed.

Please wait about 10-15 minutes for it to change to "Active". If the status still says "Pending" after waiting, please [contact us](https://prism-host.com/contact) so we can look into the issue and get your service deployed.
