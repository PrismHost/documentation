Need help? Our team is ready to assist you, however you prefer to connect. Reach out through live chat, Discord, or a support ticket. We're here to help, anytime.

All of the following information & links can be found on our ["Contact Us" page](https://prism-host.com/contact) on our main website.

## Discord Support

We offer both community provided support and tickets to interact with a support agent in our [community Discord server](https://prism-host.com/discord). 
Both the community support & ticket creation channels can be found under the "Support" category, named "#community-support" and "#create-a-ticket".

<Callout type="info">
    When opening a support forum in the #community-support channel and opening a ticket, please provide as much detail as possible to the issue you are experiencing. This helps our community members and team resolve your issue as fast as possible.

## Website Ticket 

You can open a support ticket on our [client portal](https://client.prism-host.com/submitticket.php), simply navigate to "Open Ticket" in the navbar and then choose the category that best fits your inquiry.

<Callout type="info">
    Please provide as much detail as possible in your ticket so we can resolve your issue as quickly as possible. If you aren't sure what category, just open the one you think fits the best and a member of our team will transfer it to the appropriate category if needed.
