## Step 1: Archive Your Data

Before migrating, create a compressed archive (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`) of your current server files.

- Only include the **essential data**:
    - Config files
    - World or map data
    - Plugins or mods
    - Resources
- **Exclude unnecessary directories** such as:
    - `cache/`
    - `node_modules/`
    - `logs/` (unless needed for troubleshooting)

This will keep your archive smaller and make your migration faster.

## Step 2: Upload Your Archive

You can upload your archive in one of two ways:

1. **Via S/FTP**  
    For VPS or dedicated servers, you can upload using SFTP.  
    Learn how to set up SFTP access for different services. [VPS](/vps-guides/sftp-setup). [Dedicated Servers](/dedicated-server-guides/sftp-setup), [Game Servers & Discord Bot Hosting](/game-servers/sftp-setup) & [Website Hosting](/website-guides/sftp-setup)

2. **Via the management panel**  
    If your service panel supports file uploads, you can upload your archive directly through the browser, usually through the "File Manager"


## Step 3: Extract Your Files

Once uploaded, extract the archive:

- Use the file manager or SSH (if available) to unarchive the files.
- Place them in the appropriate directory, such as:
    - `/home/container` (for game servers)
    - `/var/www/` (for web servers)
    - or whatever directory fits best
