title: Running a Traceroute
description: This guide will walk you through how to run a traceroute regardless of your operating system. A traceroute allows you to see the path your connection takes to a destination IP or domain. This is useful for diagnosing packet loss, high latency, or routing issues.

## Windows (Using WinMTR)

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Download WinMTR  
        Visit the official download page:  
        [https://github.com/White-Tiger/WinMTR/releases](https://github.com/White-Tiger/WinMTR/releases)

        Download the latest `.zip` release and extract it to a folder such as `C:\WinMTR`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Launch WinMTR  
        Open `WinMTR.exe` or `WinMTR64.exe` depending on your system. No installation is required.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Run the Traceroute  
        - In the **Host** field, enter the destination IP or domain (e.g. `google.com` or your VPS IP)  
        - Click **Start** to begin the traceroute  
        - Let it run for at least **60-120 seconds** to collect data  
        - Click **Copy Text to clipboard** or **Export HTML** to save your results

        > If a support agent asked you for this, please directly send them the text you copied.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Linux

    `mtr` combines traceroute and ping into a single tool and is preferred for live diagnostics.

    <Steps>
        <Step>
        **Install mtr**  
        ```bash
        # Debian/Ubuntu
        sudo apt install mtr

        # CentOS/RHEL/Alma/Rocky
        sudo dnf install mtr

        # Alpine
        sudo apk add mtr
        ```
        </Step>
        <Step>
        **Run mtr**  
        Replace `example.com` with the domain or IP of the destination:
        ```bash
        mtr example.com
        ```

        You can also run it in report mode:
        ```bash
        mtr --report example.com
        ```

        Press `q` to quit the live interface.

        > If a support agent asked you to run this, please take a screenshot of the report after letting it run for at least 60-120 seconds and send it to them.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

    </Tab>
        <Tab>

    <Steps>
        <Step>
        **Install traceroute**  
        On most systems, install with:
        ```bash
        # Debian/Ubuntu
        sudo apt install traceroute

        # CentOS/RHEL/Alma/Rocky
        sudo dnf install traceroute

        # Alpine
        sudo apk add traceroute
        ```
        </Step>
        <Step>
        **Run the Traceroute**  
        Replace `example.com` with your destination domain or IP:
        ```bash
        traceroute example.com
        ```

        This will display each hop (router) and latency along the path.

        > If a support agent asked you to run this, please take a screenshot of the report after letting it run for at least 60-120 seconds and send it to them.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

## What to Look For

- **High latency** at a specific hop may indicate congestion.
- **Packet loss** can point to unstable or failing network routes.
- The last hop should be the server — if it doesn't appear, there may be a block or issue in the routing path.
- Do not worry if there are some hops between that do not connect, this is usually DDoS protection endpoints.
