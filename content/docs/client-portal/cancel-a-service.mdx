## Important Notes

- **Subscription Payments:**  
  Some payment methods (like PayPal Subscriptions) may **not automatically stop recurring payments** when you cancel a service. Please [contact us](https://prism-host.com/contact) to confirm your subscription is fully cancelled.

- **No Refunds for Unused Time:**  
  Cancelling a service **does not entitle you to a refund** for any remaining time in your current billing period. The service will either stop immediately or at the end of the term, based on the option you select during cancellation.

If you have any questions or need help with the process, please [contact us](https://prism-host.com/contact).
