        #### Click "Upgrade/Downgrade"  
        In the left-hand sidebar of the service details page, click **Upgrade/Downgrade**.

        #### Choose a New Plan or Configuration  
        Select the product or configuration you'd like to switch to. The system will automatically calculate any prorated costs based on your current billing period.

        #### All Set!  
        Once payment is completed, your service will be automatically updated to reflect the new specs or plan.
