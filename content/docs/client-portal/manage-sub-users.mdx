## Adding a Sub-User

Sub-users can help manage your account, but should only be given access if absolutely necessary. Instead, consider giving access to the service specific management panels.

### Steps

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Log in to the Client Portal  
        Go to [client.prism-host.com](https://client.prism-host.com) and log in with your credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Go to User Management  
        Once logged in, click your name in the top-right corner and select **User Management**.  
        <img src={UserManagement.src} />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Invite a New User  
        Scroll down to the **Invite New User** section.  
        Enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite. They'll receive an email with a link to accept the invitation.  
        > Invitations expire after **7 days** if not accepted.  
        <img src={InviteNewUser.src} />

        > **IMPORTANT**: Adding a sub-user gives them access to your **personal information**, such as your name, address, and phone number. Only grant access to people you fully trust, and assign only the permissions they need.  
        **You are responsible for any actions taken by sub-users on your account.**
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### User Accepts the Invitation  
        Once the invited user accepts the request, they will be able to access your account with the permissions you've granted.
    </Step>
</Steps>
